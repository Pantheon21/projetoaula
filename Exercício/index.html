          <p>WAYS TO SUPPORT</p>
          <h2>Support Acme Outdoors</h2>
          <p>COVID-19 has forced us to close our retail space, but we need support from patrons like yourself now more than ever. Below, we've listed the best ways to help us through this season.</p>
          <h1>SHOP PRODUCTS</h1>
          <img src="circle.svg">
          <p>Our full product line is still available online here on our site! Getting outside and hiking is still something you can do. Get your gear now!</p>
          <h1>DONATE</h1>
          <img src="triangle.svg">
          <p>Since we've changed the way we operate to online only, and to ensure your safety, not all our staff is working. Donate to keep them afloat.</p>
          <h1>BUY GIFT CARDS</h1>
          <img src="triangle.svg">
          <p>Have all the outdoor gear you need for now? Buy a gift card and use it later or share it with friends and family.</p>

       <h2>Shop Local.</h2>
       <p>We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and state are feeling uneasy about the future - we're not sure what the future holds either.</p>
       <p>That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear you need for your adventures, and we're going to keep doing that - with our team - until the city tells us we can't.</p>
       <p>But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses around the city, then we'll be here — every day, making sure your orders arrive on time.</p>
